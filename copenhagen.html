    <!-- Paragraphs -->
    <p>Welcome to the Cisterns in Copenhagen, Denmark, where history and beautiful arts mix for unimaginable underground drama.
      Constructed in the middle of the 19th century as a water reservoir, The Cisterns now turns out as an extraordinary art gallery
      underneath the ground-level.</p>
    <p>It is just as if you stepped inside some hidden, dimly lit chambers that were slightly similar to an underground world.
      The cavernous space of the Cisterns gives it an other-worldly feel. However, what made me choose this location?</p>
    <p>I was attracted by The Cisterns, as this is no ordinary art gallery. Itâ€™s a storied place. These ancient tunnels which were
      used for water have been converted into captivating works of art. Artists create their installations in this cold and dark
      area using elements of both light and sound to manipulate these unusual surroundings.</p>

    <p>The reason for this painting is to connect history and a modern art piece in quite a surprising manner.
      It teaches us a lesson that even a place which is supposed to be utilitarian could end up serving as an impromptu canvas.
      A walkthrough The Cisterns is literally like entering a secret domain where time slips between a haunting fantasy.</p>
    <p>In this case, if one happens to be in Copenhagen, go underground for an experience of The Cisterns.
      It is not an art space but rather a captivating opportunity for discovering interesting history and creativity.</p>
